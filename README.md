# CompVis Group - DSC Research
The Computer Vision Group of DSC Research will work on problems related to vision tasks in the field of Biomedical Imaging. The current task at hand is
Multi-Class Abnormality Classification for Video Capsule Endoscopy

## Datasets
MISAHub CVIP - 
[Training and validation](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/48018562)

Dataset KVASIR - 
[KVASIR V2](https://datasets.simula.no/downloads/kvasir/kvasir-dataset-v2.zip)  
{both of these are download links}

[Citations shall be added once we start work, right now this is a skeletal repository]

## Objectives 
1. A model which provides good results on the Video Capsule Endoscopy Dataset
2. Generalized enough to be able to do good for most kinds of VCE Datasets

Our aim is to generalise it well enough to work with RI, and Galar datasets
